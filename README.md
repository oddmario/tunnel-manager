# GRE Manager

TODO...

## Glossary
- **Backend server:** It is the server that you are trying to hide/protect the IP address of.
- **GRE host:** It is the VPS (or server in general) that has the public IP address that you want to expose publicly instead of the IP of the destination server. (e.g. a BuyVM VPS)

## Configuration documentation
- `mode`
  * Can be either `backend_server` or `gre_host`.
- `main_network_interface`
  * The name of the main network interface on the system (e.g. eth0)
- `dynamic_ip_updater_api`
  * `is_enabled`: Whether to enable the dynamic IP updater API or no. This can be enabled only on the GRE host mode. Note that you have to enable this if you have any tunnels with a **DYNAMIC** `backend_server_public_ip` (ignored on the backend server mode)
  * `listen_address`: The IP address that will be used for the dynamic IP updater HTTP server. Make sure that it's binding to an IP address that the backend server(s) can access. (ignored on the backend server mode)
  * `listen_port`: The port that will be used for the dynamic IP updater HTTP server. (**Not ignored on the backend server mode!** Note that if you are configuring the GRE-Manager copy of a backend server, you need to specify this to be the same `listen_port` configured on the GRE Host configuration file)
- `tunnels`: An array of the tunnel(s) that you would like to have.
  * `gre_host_main_public_ip`: The main/primary public IP address of the GRE host.
  * `gre_host_public_ip`: The public IP address of the GRE host that you would like to use instead of the backend server IP address. If your GRE host has only one public IP address, make **gre_host_main_public_ip** and **gre_host_public_ip** equal. When they are equal, you will use your single public IP address of the GRE host for the tunneling.
  * `backend_server_public_ip`: The public IP address of the backend server. Set this to `DYNAMIC` if the backend server has a dynamic IP address.
  * `tunnel_key`: The index/key of the GRE tunnel. This has to be unique for each configured tunnel. (e.g. 1, 2, 3, etc)
  * `tunnel_interface_name`: The name of the GRE tunnel interface. This has to be unique for each configured tunnel. (e.g. gre1, gre2, gre3, etc)
  * `tunnel_rttables_id`: The ID of the routing table used by the GRE tunnel. This has to be unique for each configured tunnel. (e.g. 100, 200, 300, etc)
  * `tunnel_rttables_name`: The name of the routing table used by the GRE tunnel. This has to be unique for each configured tunnel. (e.g. TUN1, TUN2, TUN3, etc)
  * `tunnel_gateway_ip`: The gateway that will be used by GRE Manager to setup the GRE tunnel.
  * `gre_host_tunnel_ip`: The IP address of the GRE host inside the tunnel.
  * `backend_server_tunnel_ip`: The IP address of the backend server inside the tunnel.
  * `tunnel_type`: Can be either **split** for a split tunnel, or **full** for a full tunnel. A full tunnel forwards all the ports, meanwhile a split tunnel forwards certain ports that you can configure in `split_tunnel_ports`
  * `split_tunnel_ports`: An array containing the ports to forward for the purpose of split tunneling.
    * `proto`: Can be either TCP or UDP
    * `port`: The port(s) to forward. To use a port range, you can use the `start_port:end_port` format (e.g. `8000:8050`).
  * `route_all_traffic_through_tunnel`: Whether to route all the traffic on the backend server through the GRE tunnel. This is ignored on the GRE host mode and only applies to the backend server. **Note that this can be `true` only on ONE tunnel!** You can't have more than a tunnel with `route_all_traffic_through_tunnel` set as `true`.
  * `dynamic_ip_updater_key`: The secret key (and also the key that identifies each tunnel) used for dynamic IP updates. This key is used to communicate between the GRE Manager instance hosted on the GRE host and the instance hosted on the backend server. Make sure to keep `dynamic_ip_updater_key` a secret, and make sure to set the same key on the configuration files of the GRE host and the backend server. **This has to be unique for each configured tunnel.**

## Installation as a service

**On both the GRE host and the backend server(s):**

1. Store your configuration file at `/etc/gremanager/config.json`

   You can copy the example configuration file and change it to serve your needs.

2. Place the binary file of GRE Manager at `/usr/local/bin` (e.g. `/usr/local/bin/gremanager`)

3. Make the binary file executable: `chmod u+x /usr/local/bin/gremanager`

4. Create a systemd service for GRE Manager. This can be done by creating `/etc/systemd/system/gremanager.service` to have this content:
```
[Unit]
Description=GREManager
After=network.target

[Service]
User=root
WorkingDirectory=/usr/local/bin
LimitNOFILE=2097152
TasksMax=infinity
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/gremanager /etc/gremanager/config.json
Restart=on-failure
StartLimitInterval=180
StartLimitBurst=30
RestartSec=5s

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

5. Enable the GRE Manager service on startup & start it now:
```
systemctl enable --now gremanager.service
```
